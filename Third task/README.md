Hello

This one builds electrical tension lines —Åorrectly!
(I've spent too much time for normal work of this code)

To place a positive charge you should press button "R" on your keyboard.
To get a negative one - button "N".
To draw a line through certain point - press left button of your mouse.

By the way, here's few problems i don't want to fix: 
1) If you try to draw a line without charges you'll propably get segfault or something else
2) You cannot delete all lines and add new charges after drawing
